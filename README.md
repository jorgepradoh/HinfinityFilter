# HinfinityFilter
Project describing the H infinity filter for state estimation

In this project we recreate the results of the article: 
Simon, D. (2006). Optimal State Estimation: Kalman, Hâˆž, and Nonlinear Approaches. https://doi.org/10.1002/0470045345.ch11

We implement the program in MATLAB based off the references in the PDF.
